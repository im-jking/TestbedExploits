# Virtual Testbed Exploits for Evaluation
Basic ICS ransomware implementations in Python for the purpose of testing systems security.

The folder "BasicRansom" contains an exfiltration/encryption reverse shell for testing on HMI systems.

The folder "PyModbus" contains two exploits for Modbus vulnerabilities:

- "actuatorState" demonstrates an actuator state injection via a MitM attack.

- "setpointMod" demonstrates an alarm setpoint modification via external access.
  
- "Basics" contains the fundamental Modbus client/server program used for both exploits.

All test exploits were executed on a virtual testbed that utilizes VirtualBox to simulat and ICS environment.
